# Trees

Indexes in Noblit are [hitchhiker trees][hitchhiker]. The trees have the same
on-disk format as memory format, which allows them to be memory mapped. A
hitchhiker tree is similar to an immutable B-tree, but updates usually only
allocate a single new node, rather than log<sub>B</sub>(n) nodes. This gives us
the advantages of an immutable data structure, without the write amplification.

Tree nodes in Noblit are immutable. Index updates produce new nodes that succeed
older nodes. Nodes can become unreachable, but they are never removed.
Eventually, many nodes in a file may not be reachable. In that case the tree can
be copied to a _new_ file, omitting the unreachable blocks. This is a copying
garbage collection.

## Index Trees 

Indexes in Noblit are sorted sets of datoms. Each datom is 32 bytes. (For large
values, the datom contains a reference to a value on the heap.) The indexes
store the datoms themselves: they are sorted sets, not key-values maps. In other
words, indexes are *covering indexes*.

Trees in Noblit are based on B-trees, which means that datoms in the interior
nodes are not repeated in the leaf nodes. (Unlike a B+ tree, which would store
all datoms in leaf nodes, and repeat some in the interior nodes.)

In addition to the midpoint datoms, tree nodes store *pending* datoms: datoms
that need to be flushed into the leaves, but which we avoid as long as possible.
This modification is what makes the tree a hitchhiker tree.

## Disk Format

Tree nodes are 4096 bytes.

 * Byte 4088 through 4095 contains the node header, which is built up of the
   following 8 bytes:
   * Byte 0 contains the depth of the node (0 for a leaf, 1 for its parent, etc.).
   * Byte 1 contains the number of datoms in the node internally, say <var>k</var>.
     <var>k</var> is at most 102.
     TODO: Leaf nodes could store 127 datoms and no child page ids,
     as opposed to 102 midpoints.
   * The remaining 6 bytes are currently not used.
     TODO: I could store a checksum there.
 * At byte 0, the datom array starts. It contains <var>k</var> datoms in
   increasing order.
 * At byte 3264, the child array starts. It contains 64-bit page ids of the
   child nodes. The child array has <var>k</var> + 1 elements, such that all
   datoms in node `children[i]` order before `datoms[i]`. All datoms in node
   `children[i + 1]` order after `datoms[i]`. The special value
   2<sup>64</sup> â€“ 1 indicates that there is no child node in this slot.
   If this is the case for slot <var>i</var>, then datom <var>i</var> is a
   *pending* datom rather than a midpoint, and that datom should be flushed
   to a child node if space runs out in the node.
