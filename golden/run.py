"""
A test runner for running the golden tests.

The runner takes golden input files, splits them into queries and expectations,
runs the query, and prints whether the results match the expectations. This
relies on "parse.py" for parsing queries, and the "src/bin/execute.rs" binary
for executing them.

Output is TAP (Test Anything Protocol) compliant, so you can run all of the
golden tests with Prove while using this script as interpreter (with --exec).

Standalone usage:
  golden/run.py file.t

Interpreter usage:
  prove --exec golden/run.py golden
